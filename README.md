üîß **Key Features Explained**

**Status System**

Players can have different statuses that affect their gameplay:

* Active (on mission): Normal gameplay
* Arrested: Communications monitored by ELLI
* Hacked: Messages intercepted by Technocrats
* Dead: No communication possible
* Traitor: Special status for plot purposes

**Message Filtering**

The bot implements sophisticated message filtering based on player status:

* Arrested players trigger security alerts
* Hacked players have messages intercepted
* Dead players receive no responses

**Image Caching**

To improve performance, the bot caches Telegram file IDs for images:

* First upload stores the file ID
* Subsequent uses reference the cached ID
* Reduces upload time and bandwidth
